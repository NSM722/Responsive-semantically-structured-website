# Artful Salads with Two Trees Olive Oil 

This project is built from watching the LinkedIn __Course of Crafting Semantic HTML__ by Jen Kramer

The course enabled me to craft semantic, meaningful HTML

## Course description

Structure and make web content available to more people and more programs by using built-in behaviors in HTML to reduce the amount of explicit code needed 

The course helps one to make sure the web pages (including elements like navigation) are properly structured, sectioned and shows how to use the language's unique features for representing quotes, figures, dates, and times

__Other semantic tags learnt but not used in this project are:__

```html
<abbr>
<code>
<details> - Enables accordion like functionality
<kbd> - Keyboard Tag => this tag can further 
        be styled in css using properties such as: 
          - padding
          - box-shadow
          - border-radius 
          - border
<noscript>
<pre> - using this tag in combination with the code tag
<samp>
<summary> - Enables accordion like functionality
<wbr> - Word Break Tag
&shy; - Word break with a hyphen included
```

## Extras
Positioned elements on the page by using CSS Grid and Flexbox
