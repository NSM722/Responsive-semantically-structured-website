            <h3>Dressing up a Salad</h3>
            <p>Summer is nearly here! We love this season because it’s the perfect time to eat all the great organic
              vegetables
              from
              our neighboring farms. One way to enjoy the delicious abundance of fresh fruits and vegetables is in salads.
              However,
              at Two Trees we <em>refuse</em> to eat boring, tasteless salads. Therefore, we’re going to share with you the
              reasons to
              make
              your own, and the basics for creating custom salad dressings.
            </p>
          </article>
          <article class="flex-item-dressing box">
            <h4>Make it to your taste</h4>
    
            <p>There are four main ingredient types to consider when making a salad dressing: fat, acid, sweetener, and
              spice.
              For
              fat we recommend olive oil because it carries flavor so well and it has so many healthy properties, though you
              can
              definitely try different oils or healthy fats like avocado.</p>
          </article>
          <div class="d-flex">
            <article class="flex-item-make box">
              <h4>
                Make your own salad dressing
              </h4>
      
              <p>Sure, the grocery store is full of salad dressings, but <strong>often they’re full of preservatives that
                  impact
                  the
                  taste
                  and
                  nutritional value of the dressing</strong>. Furthermore, they can sit on the shelf for a long time before
                they’re bought,
                which
                can further reduce the nutritional value of the product.</p>
      
              <p>
                To get started designing your own custom dressing, you need as little as two ingredients: an oil and an acid.
                From
                there you can get as creative as you like.</p>
            </article>
            <article class="flex-item-home box">
              <h4>Homemade salad dressing is good for your health</h4>
        
              <p>Olive oil contains polyphenols which, according to research, can play a role in slowing cardiovascular and
                  neurodegenerative diseases. Olive oil also has antioxidant properties. Research into vinegar shows it might be
                  slightly helpful with controlling the body’s glycemic response. Together there’s no doubt, they’re delicious!
              </p>
        
              <p>We use this basic combination here in our <a
                  href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/212896/caprese-appetizer/" target="_blank">bite-sized Caprese salad
                  appetizer</a>
                using mini mozzarella balls and
                cherry
                tomatoes. We serve this with our basil infused olive oil and aged balsamic vinegar. It’s amazing!</p>

            <article class="flex-item-sweet box">
              <h5>Sweeteners</h5>
      
              <p>Sugar is a common sweetener used in store-bought salad dressings. However, we recommend trying a sweet fruit
                juice
                like orange or a natural sweetener like agave or honey. In fact, if you want an emulsifier in your dressing,
                honey
                is
                an excellent choice. A nice benefit of making your own dressing is that you can control how much added sugar
                is
                going
                into your food.</p>
            </article>
          </div>
          <article class="flex-item-spice box">
            <h5>Spice</h5>
    
            <p>Start with salt. A little can go a long way and bring out the natural sweetness in your fruits and
              vegetables.
              Experiment with herbs like rosemary, mint, basil, or tarragon. If you’re wanting some extra zip or an
              emulsifier,
              try
              Dijon mustard.</p>
    
            <p>The trick to making a brilliant salad dressing is to explore flavors and flavor combinations you enjoy. Take
              some
              time
              this summer and have fun experimenting with the abundance of healthy foods and flavors!</p>

          <article class="flex-item-acids box text-center">
            <h5>Acids</h5>
    
            <p>The two most common acids in a salad dressing are vinegars and fruit juices.This might require some delicious
              experimentation!</p>
